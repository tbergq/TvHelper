# Flow

### Upgrading dependencies

With many workspaces, you might run into a situation where you have too many errors after upgrading. Since you want to keep your PR's small, this might be the best way to proceed: 

1. clone Flow repository somewhere (`git@github.com:facebook/flow.git`)
2. jump into dev tools (`flow/packages/flow-dev-tools`) and install necessary deps using Yarn
3. you can now run `./tool` from the Flow repo root which enables you very useful utilities for the upgrades

There are 2 useful commands for the upgrades: `add-comments` and `remove-comments`. To add suppress comments run this comment (don't forget to adjust it):

```text
/path/to/tool add-comments --all --bin /path/to/flow --comment "\$FlowFixMe(>=<flow_version>)" .
```

Add `suppress_comment=\\(.\\|\n\\)*\\$FlowFixMe\\($\\|[^(]\\|(\\(<VERSION>\\)? *\\(site=[a-z,_]+\\)?)\\)`, so it understands the version in `$FlowFixMe` correctly (it suppresses the error only from the specified version up). Example of such a suppression comment:

```js
/* $FlowFixMe(>=0.102.0) This comment suppresses an error when upgrading Flow.
 * To see the error delete this comment and run Flow. */
```

To remove unused suppress comments run:

```text
/path/to/tool remove-comments --bin /path/to/flow .
```

This command removes all unused suppress comments while keeping unused comments in flowtests (files ending with `*-flowtest.js` or files in `__flowtests__` directory).

Tip: great way how to migrate some large scale changes is to use `npx flow-upgrade`.
